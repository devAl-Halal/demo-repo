            <p style="text-indent: 20px;">My name is <b>Akinlabi Zainab Oloalde</b>. I am a student at <b>LAUTECH</b>, studying <b>Computer Science</b>, with a strong interest in building a career in technology. I'm training to become a web developer, currently learning the foundational tools and skills required to grow in the field.</p>
            <p style="text-indent: 20px;">Alongside my academic and tech journey, I am also an entrepreneur. I run a small-scale snacks business called <b>Al Halal Snacks</b>. which focuses on providing hygienic, affordable, and delicious CHINCHIN. I personally oversee production, packaging, and sales â€” ensuring quality and consistency at every step.</p>
            <p style="text-indent: 20px;">Balancing both my studies and business has taught me the value of time management, self-discipline, and customer service. I am passionate about growth, both as a future tech professional and a business owner, and I'm committed to continuous learning and excellence in everything I do.</p>
